**Farkle Rules**

---

**Goal:** Be the player with the highest score over 10,000.

---

**Farkle Facts:**

- **1s = 100 pts** | **5s = 50 pts**
- Points for **3+ of same number** (see Scoring)
- Combine only dice from **same roll** for sets
- **Must score at least 500** in one turn to start scoring
- **Must set aside at least 1 die** each roll
- If **no scoring dice** after roll → FARKLE (lose all turn points)
- You may roll all 6 dice again if you score with all dice in a roll or series of rolls

---

**Scoring Table:**

- Single 1 = 100 pts
- Single 5 = 50 pts
- Three 1s = 300 pts
- Three 2s = 200 pts
- Three 3s = 300 pts
- Three 4s = 400 pts
- Three 5s = 500 pts
- Three 6s = 600 pts
- Four of a kind = 1,000 pts
- Five of a kind = 2,000 pts
- Six of a kind = 3,000 pts
- 1–6 straight = 1,500 pts
- Three pairs = 1,500 pts
- Four of a kind + pair = 1,500 pts
- Two triplets = 2,500 pts

---

**Turn Flow (Expanded):**

1. Roll all 6 dice.
2. Set aside one or more scoring dice.
   - Scoring combinations must come from the **same roll**.
   - You **must** set aside at least one scoring die after each roll.
3. If **none** of the rolled dice score, it’s a **Farkle**:
   - You lose all points accumulated that turn.
   - Your turn ends immediately.
4. If you have dice remaining, you may:
   - **Stop and bank** your current turn total (if ≥ 500 or already banked 500 before).
   - **Continue rolling** the remaining dice to add to your score.
5. If all 6 dice score (in one roll or over multiple), you get a **hot dice** bonus:
   - You may roll all 6 again and continue your turn.
6. At any point, you may voluntarily stop rolling and bank your turn total.
7. Once banked, points are recorded on the Score Pad and cannot be lost.

---

**Winning the Game:**

- First player to exceed 10,000 triggers the **final round**.
- Each remaining player gets one more turn to **beat** that total (no ties). That does mean some lucky players may get an extra turn compared to the others.
- **Highest final score wins**.

---

**Sample Turn (Using Numbers):**

- Roll 1: [5, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1] → Set aside 5 (50 pts)
- Roll 2: [5, 5, 2, 1, 2] → Set aside 1 (100), 5, 5, 5 (400)
- Total = 550 → Continue or stop?
- Roll 3: [1] → 100 → Total = 650 → All dice used → Roll all 6 again
- Roll 4: [3, 3, 3, 4, 6, 5] → Set aside 3, 3, 3 (300) → Stop → Score = 950 pts

---

**Key Terms:**

- **Farkle:** A roll with no scoring dice.
- **Running Total:** Points accumulated this turn (not yet banked).
- **Score Pad:** Used to record banked points after a player stops rolling.
