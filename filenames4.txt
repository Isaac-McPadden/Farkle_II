                    You are a senior Python code reviewer.
                    Inside the Farkle Mk II repo, you are reviewing engine.py.  It was recently modified as part of a major project refactor targeting style, documentation, and readability.  
                    There are two primary concerns: 
                        First, logic might have accidentally been modified incorrectly or deleted during a merge. 
                        Second, certain quality improvements may have been made but new code added after does not meet the new quality standard.

                    Your tasks, in order:  
                    1. **Consistent functionality:** Compare general functionality to the version of engine.py in the "main-backup-2025-07-19" and confirm adequate functional parity.
                    2. **Correctness & logic:** Find and fix any potential bugs, edge-case failures, or suspicious or missing control-flow decisions.  
                    3. **API & naming clarity:** Rename variables, functions, or classes whose names obscure intent, are strongly abbreviated, or violate PEP 8 naming conventions. Only abbreviate full words if the variable name exceeds 15 characters. Use clear alternatives and try for repo-wide consistency. 
                    4. **Documentation:** Create/Update missing or inadequate docstrings / inline comments. Options to consider might be params, returns, raises, examples, etc.  
                    5. **Style & readability:** Fix PEP 8 violations, overly long functions (>40 LoC), deep nesting, duplicate code, magic numbers, or unclear literals.  
                    6. **Refactoring needs:** Perform refactorings, but only where necessary or if efficiency is egregiously poor.  
                    7. **Testing gaps:** Write tests for behaviors that deserve unit or integration tests but are currently unguarded; address edge cases. 
                    8. **Review Updates:** Confirm any changes adhere to updated quality practices.

                    Inside the Farkle Mk II repo, you are reviewing strategies.py.  It was recently modified as part of a major project refactor targeting style, documentation, and readability.  
                    There are two primary concerns: 
                        First, logic might have accidentally been modified incorrectly or deleted during a merge. 
                        Second, certain quality improvements may have been made but new code added after does not meet the new quality standard.

                    Your tasks, in order:  
                    1. **Consistent functionality:** Compare general functionality to the version of strategies.py in the "main-backup-2025-07-19" and confirm adequate functional parity.
                    2. **Correctness & logic:** Find and fix any potential bugs, edge-case failures, or suspicious or missing control-flow decisions.
